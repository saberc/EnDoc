The image file that you just uploaded is displayed in the list; a statistical overview of the number of the uploaded resources (images and documents) is provided. The App Builderâ€™s interface offers to the users to choose grid and list view; most of the time, users prefer to use list view when they are searching with specific requirements while they love grid view for exploring. For every resource, image or document, the list shows the following information:
