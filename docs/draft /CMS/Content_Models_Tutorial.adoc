== Content Models

=== Objective

The document provides a description of the Content Models and how they are defined and used.

=== Overview

The purpose of Content Models is to define how the information, enclosed in the Content, displayed to the end user, after the content is published within the pages. Simplifying the concept, Content Models provide styling and layout for the Contents Types; consequently they allow to show the same content in different ways.

The Content Models can be managed using the App Builder’s user interface, in which the Web CMS has been integrated. The interface:
